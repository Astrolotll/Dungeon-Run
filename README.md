A roguelike made using react.js and rot.js

(Made as a project for a course) 
An attempt to make a (almost finished) roguelike using React js. 
Almost everything works except the stairs and the enemies (when they have a health value higher than 1). 
Collect loot and battle through the dungeon. (any help fixing the issues would be a godsend as I can't figure out why they happen.)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

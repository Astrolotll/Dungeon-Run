# Dungeon-Run
A roguelike using react.js along with the rot-js library.


(Made as a project for a course)

An attempt to make a (almost finished) roguelike using React js. 
Almost everything works except the stairs and the enemies (when they have a health value higher than 1). 
Collect loot and battle through the dungeon. (any help fixing the issues would be a godsend as I can't figure out why they happen.)
